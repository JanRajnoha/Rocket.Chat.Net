## TODO

- [X] Handle disconnects (Needs testing)
- [ ] Get rid of dynamics (Moving over to JObjects)
- [ ] Handle errors proactively (Some methods are covered, e.g. login)
- [ ] An api similar to Margie Bot for Slack (e.g. inline lambda responders, standalone Responders, etc.)
- [ ] Programmatic bot modifications (e.g. change avatar, etc.)
- [ ] Continuous integration testing on a real Rocket.Chat server (need a way to verify interactions)
- [ ] Get test converage
- [ ] A way to unsub
- [ ] Figure out why tests are stuck when running in parallel. - It runs correctly locally from the cli. I almost looks like the tests don't even start
